Constraint Propagation

Monty Hall Problem



Search Algorithm

Depth-First Search
Minimax Algorithm

Depth-Limited Search
Alpha-Beta Pruning
Probabilistic Alpha-Beta Pruning | eliminating tree branches based on a minimum and maximum limit for the state score estimation
Forward Pruning | some moves at a given node are pruned immediately without further consideration
Beam Search | forward pruning, remaining with the best moves according to an evaluation function

Breadth-First Search

Quiescent Search | until it gives similar results
Iterative Deepening

Game Play
Adversarial Search
Horizon Effect | algorithm does not see an outcome that is clear for a human player
Killer Move Heuristic | trying the best moves first
Transposition Table | hash table of previously seen positions
Heuristic Evaluation Function | function which returns an estimate of the expected utility of the game from a given position
